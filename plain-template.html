     <h1>College Football: Does Spending More Mean Winning More?</h1>

    <p>Over the past 10 years in College Football, there have been two constants in the sport. The Big Ten Conference and South Eastern Conference, have won the most games and spent the most money.
    </p>

     <p>This trend suggests that there is a direct correlation between spending and winning in the sport, and when you take a closer look into these conferences over the past 5 seasons (2017-2021), this theory holds some serious weight.

    <p>Out of the top ten teams in these conferences in terms of spending over the past 5 years, 8 of them finished top ten in wins. The two outliers are Florida and Tennesee who ranked top 10 in spending and outside the top 10 in win total.

        <p>So where is all this spending actually going? There are seven categories that college football teams spend their money on: Medical, Recruiting, Facilities and Equipment, Coach's Compensation, Athletic Student Aid, Game Expenses, Competition guarantees, and Support and Admin Compensation w/Severance.  
 </p>
        <p>It could be argued that any one of these categories is most important when it comes to winning, but Roman Goode, Defensive Personnel/Recruiting Analyst at Tennesee University says there are two main categories, recruiting and medical expenses that outweigh the others.
 </p>
        <p>“Yeah spending totally equates to winning if you look at last year Georgia outspent everyone on recruiting and won the whole thing,” Goode said.
        </p>

        <p>Georgia, the back-to-back national champions did in fact spend over one million more than the next highest team on recruiting in 2021. Spending money on recruiting can lead to winning because teams are using their resources to go after the top high school players in America which allows them to keep their rosters loaded with talent. In fact, three of the top 5 teams in terms of spending on recruiting in the Big Ten and SEC, made the College Football Playoff in 2021. This included Michigan whose freshman quarterback J.J. McCarthy led them to a Big Ten Championship and a playoff birth. So it is very clear that there is a direct correlation between spending on recruiting and winning.

        <p>Goode also said that spending, in terms of medical, is vital in terms of winning on the field. 
</p>
        <p>“Keeping your players healthy, with good nutrition staffs and good training staffs lets their players worry about the game rather than their health and keeps teams healthy which is key to winning,” Goode said.
</p>
        <p> Once again Goode hit the nail on the head. Going back to the 2021 season, Georgia, Alabama, and Ohio State all finished as the Top 6 teams in the country, and all three were in the top 4 in terms of spending on medical. This is just yet another trend that backs up the theory that spending equals winning.

        <p>Unfortunately, for some teams, this isn’t an even playing field. A smaller school like Rutgers can't just decide to spend six million dollars on recruiting to compete with a large school like Georgia. It’s the bigger schools like Alabama and Ohio State, who have the resources to invest so much money in the sport and it leaves the little guys left with the crumbs. 

</p>
        <p>With the new Name Image Likeness rules in place that allow college football players to make money through their NIL, spending by teams is only going to matter more. While there is already a clear trend between spending and winning it may, in the near future, be the lone key to a team's success. 
</p>
        <p>For now, it would seem that the theory of spending equating to winning in college football is true. In the two most dominant conferences in the sport, those who spend more, win more. This trend has made teams outside of these conferences incentivized to join them By 2024 college football powerhouses such as USC, Oklahoma, and Texas will all be in either the Big Ten or the SEC. The reason for this: There is more money to be made if you’re in these conferences, and as we’ve seen more money equals more wins.
